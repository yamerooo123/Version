**VERSION**

Linux binary for checking any tool version for forgetful people!

UNDER DEVELOPMENT!

Contributors are welcome!

**Brief idea**

I will convert binaries to plain text to prevent them from executing the command first. Then i will check version using different version flasg(-v, --v, --version, -version). I will try to test on popular tools first then if it works 100%. I will probably add function like auto update suggester function. The command usage is "version BINARY". the purpose of this binary is to make Linux enjoyer's life easier for the sake of simplicity.
